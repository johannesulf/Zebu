Here, we provide machine-readable tables for all figures in the DESI publication "The DESI lensing mock challenge: systematic effects in galaxy--galaxy lensing estimators." In the following, we list the files associated with each figure. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we use the convention that BGS-1, BGS-2, BGS-3, LRG-1, and LRG-2 correspond to the lens bins 0 to 4, respectively. Lens bin 5 would correspond to LRG-3 which was not included in this analysis. For file names, "gt" refers to the tangential shear $\gamma_{\mathrm{t}}$ and "ds" to the excess surface density $\Delta\Sigma$.
